# Multiplicative Group Modulo 5 (Z*5)

### Group Elements

The group Z*5 consists of integers coprime to 5: {1, 2, 3, 4}

### Group Operation

Multiplication modulo 5

### Verification of Group Axioms

## 1. Closure

For any elements a, b in {1, 2, 3, 4}, (a * b) mod 5 will always be in the set:

- 1 * 2 ≡ 2 (mod 5)
- 3 * 4 ≡ 12 ≡ 2 (mod 5)
- 2 * 3 ≡ 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5)

## 2. Associativity

Multiplication is always associative:

- (a * b) * c ≡ a * (b * c) (mod 5)

## 3. Identity Element

The element 1 serves as the identity:

- 1 * a ≡ a (mod 5) for all a in the group

## 4. Inverse Elements

Each element has a multiplicative inverse:

- 1⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod 5)
- 2⁻¹ ≡ 3 (mod 5) [because 2 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5)]
- 3⁻¹ ≡ 2 (mod 5) [because 3 * 2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)]
- 4⁻¹ ≡ 4 (mod 5) [because 4 * 4 ≡ 1 (mod 5)]
